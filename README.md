Abstract
Indonesia is known as an agrarian country because most of its people live in agriculture. However, post-pandemic (2022-2023) the interest of the younger generation has decreased in the agricultural sector. They tend to "avoid" and are reluctant to learn how to farm or garden. So we need a system that can provide education to millennials regarding the science of gardening by utilizing technology through the introduction of plant disease detection applications, planting tutorials, and recomendation planting base on resident that can increase the millennial generation's interest in and assist farmers in increasing crop productivity and quality in a way that easy, simple and accurate. Also, it can reduce production costs and losses due to plant disease outbreaks.
